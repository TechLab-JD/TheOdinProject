    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (10 pound) whole turkey, neck and giblets removed</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons seasoned salt</li>
        <li>½ cup butter</li>
        <li>2 (12 fluid ounce) cans cola-flavored carbonated beverage</li>
        <li>1 medium apple, quartered</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, quartered</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 cups hickory wood chips, or more as needed (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the smoker:
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat a smoker to 225 to 250 °F (110 to 120 °C).</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Prepare the turkey:
            <ol>
                <li>Pat the turkey dry thoroughly with paper towels—inside and out.</li>
                <li>Rub crushed garlic over the outside of the turkey, and sprinkle with seasoned salt. Transfer to a disposable roasting pan.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Stuff the turkey:
            <ol>
                <li>Fill the turkey cavity with butter, cola, apple, onion, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.</li>
                <li>Cover the turkey loosely with foil.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Begin smoking:
            <ol>
                <li>Add wood chips to the smoker according to the manufacturer’s directions.</li>
                <li>Place the roasting pan in the preheated smoker.</li>
                <li>Smoke the turkey, basting every 1‑2 hours with juices from the bottom of the roasting pan, for about 5 hours.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Continue smoking until done:
            <ol>
                <li>Add more wood chips if desired.</li>
                <li>Continue smoking and basting until the turkey is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear — about 4 to 5 more hours.</li>
                <li>Insert an instant‑read thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone; it should read about 180 °F (80 °C).</li>
                <li>Remove from the smoker, tent loosely with foil, and let rest for 20 minutes before carving.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
