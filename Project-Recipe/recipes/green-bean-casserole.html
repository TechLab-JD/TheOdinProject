    <h4>This green bean casserole is made entirely from scratch using frozen green beans, fresh cremini mushrooms, onions, and herbs, all combined in a rich, creamy cheese sauce. It offers a fresh, “no-canned bean” take on the classic holiday favorite.</h4>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>2 (12 ounce) packages frozen French‑cut green beans</li>
    <li>8 ounces crimini mushrooms, quartered</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>1 small onion, halved and thinly sliced</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons all‑purpose flour</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon lemon zest</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
    <li>½ cup milk</li>
    <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
    <li>½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    <li>1 (2.8 ounce) can French‑fried onions</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 °F (175 °C).</li>
    <li>Place the frozen green beans in a saucepan with roughly ½ inch water; bring to a boil, cover and steam until the beans are tender but still bright green (about 5 minutes). Drain.</li>
    <li>In a bowl, combine the drained green beans with the mushrooms; toss to mix.</li>
    <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the sliced onion and chopped parsley; cook and stir until the onion is tender (about 5‑7 minutes).</li>
    <li>Whisk the flour into the cooked onion mixture until blended; then mix in the lemon zest, salt, and pepper.</li>
    <li>Gradually whisk in the milk, stirring constantly to avoid lumps.</li>
    <li>Add the sour cream and stir until well combined; warm the sauce over medium heat until it just begins to bubble.</li>
    <li>Remove the skillet from heat and stir in the green beans and mushrooms until they are coated with the sauce.</li>
    <li>Stir in half of the Cheddar cheese and half of the French‑fried onions.</li>
    <li>Transfer the mixture into a 1½‑quart casserole dish; top with the remaining Cheddar cheese and the remaining French‑fried onions.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the Cheddar melts, about 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
